### Context API

### CountdownCircleTimer
A React Native component that provides a countdown timer with a circular progress indicator.

### Rest API
In the QuizHacker project, the REST API is used to fetch data from the server. The fetch() function is used to make HTTP requests to the server and retrieve JSON data in response.

### Vibration API
This API allows web developers to access the vibration hardware of a device and trigger vibration patterns. In my case, the Vibration API is used to trigger a short vibration when the quiz process begins to provide feedback to the user and enhance their experience.

### Expo Camera

### Firebase Storage
